A plugin for blender 2.79 that helps you make stylized hair out of curves way easier, built in FAQ that makes it easy to get stated. Numbered steps to help you know which buttons to pick in order, It's awesome.
I'll make one for blender 3 later. I know more about blender 279 curve system than 3 so I wante dto go in strong with what I knew vs what i didnt.
